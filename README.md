===========

Got Wheels?  Where do you spin them?

How_iRoll is a fun little app to help log your journies... on wheels.
If youre walking or flying you can walk or fly on to the next app buddy.
At any time type "opt" for available options or enter new options by typing
'enter'...  i.e. available options for our first question are: 'bike' or
'bicycle'; 'sd' or 'Sunday driver'; skate or 'skateboard'; 'moto' or
'motorcycle'; 'hid' or 'hidden options'.

where_iRoll is for bicyclists, bikers and Sunday drivers.  It keeps track of great places you ride or drive so you can share and remember your favorite locations.
